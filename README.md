# Movie Recommender System



## About the Project

Using ratings provided by users on movies they have watched, possible movie recommender systems have been developed using various concepts. A simple recommender has been developed to recommend the most popular movies based on general consensus. To improve the simple recommender, the genre of the top rated movies by any given user was also considered for the Genre-Based Popularity Recommender. Lastly, collaborative filtering was used to develop a deep learning model to make recommendations for any given user.
